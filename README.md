# GLFW_OpenGL

Learning OpenGL is an endless mystery. I have only interest in certain parts of it but I have a few projects in this repository which are of infinite value to me.

I usually use my Tetris game Chaste Tris as a test for whether my OpenGL code is working correctly. It has been ported over to OpenGL from the original SDL graphics functions. GLFW is used as the windowing library and I like it because it is pretty much the standard if you need an OpenGL context library that is cross platform.
